Installing Zabbix with docker-compose
For Zabbix installation with Docker, we will use a docker-compose.yml file to configure Zabbix differents:

The Zabbix server
The database (MariaDB)
The web interface
A monitoring agent for Zabbix server.
To make it easier for you, I have created a repository with the necessary files which can be found here : https://git.rdr-it.io/docker/zabbix.


sudo git clone https://git.rdr-it.io/docker/zabbix.git .
